Here is where you can create your own Team Page with the employee data retrieved from a CLI. 

"As a manager
I wanted to generate a strong webpage that displays my team's basic info
so that I have quick access to emails and GitHub profiles"

You will be prompted with many questions including an employee name, ID, email, and title. Each title has it's own specific questions as well. After the questions have been answered you will be prompted to create your own html page with your team's data showed.
